'''Trains a LSTM on the IMDB sentiment classification task.

The dataset is actually too small for LSTM to be of any advantage
compared to simpler, much faster methods such as TF-IDF+LogReg.

Notes:

- RNNs are tricky. Choice of batch size is important,
choice of loss and optimizer is critical, etc.
Some configurations won't converge.

- LSTM loss decrease patterns during training can be quite different
from what you see with CNNs/MLPs/etc.
