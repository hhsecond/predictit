## Predictor


How to use the fetch_data_script:

There are some issues with the lxml installation but other than that all other installations in virtualenv should be fine

This was done using python2.7

cd /home/<user>/predictor
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r fetching_data_scripts/requirements.txt
